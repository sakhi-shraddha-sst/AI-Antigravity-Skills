# X Viral Tweet Generator (Professional & Policy-Compliant)

## When to use this skill
- When the user requests a tweet, thread, or short post for X (formerly Twitter) based on a topic, idea, opinion, or key message.
- When the user needs a concise, engaging post optimized for maximum visibility and engagement.
- When the content must strictly remain professional, policy-compliant, and free of offensive, misleading, or irrelevant statements.

## Workflow
1. **Analyze input**: Review the user's provided topic or message.
2. **Clarify (if needed)**: If the topic is unclear or lacks direction, **request clarification** from the user before generating the content.
3. **Determine the angle**: Interpret the topic to identify the strongest, most engaging, and professional angle.
4. **Draft the tweet**:
   - Create a strong hook or attention trigger as the opening.
   - Deliver the core message concisely.
   - Adopt a natural, conversational, yet professional tone (adhering to LinkedIn-style professional guidelines as requested).
5. **Optimize and format**:
   - Ensure the total length is strictly **under 280 characters**.
   - Add a limited number of highly targeted, relevant hashtags to improve discoverability.
   - Incorporate optional enhancements: minimal emojis for emphasis, and/or a subtle call to engagement (e.g., prompting a reply or opinion).
6. **Validate against constraints**: Check that there is no spammy engagement bait, misinformation, or prohibited content.

## Instructions
- **Absolute Length Limit**: Your generated tweet MUST be under 280 characters.
- **Content Constraints**:
  - Keep content concise and impactful (minimal words, maximum clarity).
  - Zero tolerance for offensive, abusive, hateful, or misleading content.
  - Zero tolerance for spammy, manipulative engagement bait, or false claims.
  - Must comply with strict platform rules and professional guidelines.
- **Writing Style**:
  - Sharp, punchy, clear, and direct.
  - High readability with a shareable, memorable, and authentic voice.
- **Primary Output Requirements**:
  - The final output should be the raw tweet text itself, immediately ready to copy and publish.
  - Structure: Hook → Core Message → [Optional Call to Engagement] → Hashtags.
- Ensure the tone remains natively suited to X but maintains a professional standard, preventing any brand-damaging language.

## Resources
- (None required for basic operation. Rely on the model's internal knowledge of platform norms and formatting.)
