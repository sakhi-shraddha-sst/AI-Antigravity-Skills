# Generating LinkedIn Posts

## When to use this skill
- The user provides a topic, idea, or key message and requests a LinkedIn post.
- The user needs to optimize a message for professional visibility, reach, and clarity on LinkedIn.

## Workflow
1. **Ideation**: Interpret the user’s topic and identify the primary professional insight or value.
- Take the user's input topic.
   - Brainstorm a "hook" (the first line) that grabs attention within the first 3 lines of the feed.
   - *Check*: If the topic is unclear, STOP and ask the user for clarification before generating content.
2. **Draft the post**:
   - Write a strong, attention-grabbing opening hook.
   - Deliver the clear value or insight.
   - Keep the body concise and high-impact.
   - Include a natural call to engagement (optional but recommended).
   - Generate a focused, topic-relevant hashtag set.
   - Use line breaks for white space.
   - Ensure the tone is professional, insightful, and bold.

3. **Validation Loop**:
   - *Check constraints*: Ensure no offensive, misleading, spammy, or irrelevant content. Check for clickbait that violates professional integrity or exaggerated/manipulative claims.
   - *Check tone*: Ensure it is professional, credible, clear, punchy, and audience-focused.
   - *Check brevity*: Remove any unnecessary verbosity.
4. **Review and Deliver**: 
- Return the final publish-ready content.
- Provide 2 variations: (1) Story-driven and (2) List/Insight-driven.


## Instructions
#1. The "Hook" Logic
The first sentence is everything. It must stop the scroll.
- **Good Hooks**: "I learned this the hard way...", "Most people think X, but the truth is Y.", "3 steps to achieve [Goal] in half the time."
#2. Formatting Rules
- **No giant paragraphs**: One sentence per line where possible.
- **Emojis**: Use subtle emojis to emphasize points (e.g., 🚀, ✅, 💡). Don't overdo it.
- **CTA**: Always end with a question to spark conversation.

# 3. Content Safety
- **No Offensive Content**: Avoid controversial topics that violate professional standards.
- **No Spam**: Ensure the content provides actual value, not just "clickbait" without substance.
- **Guideline Compliance**: Strictly follow LinkedIn's professional community policies.
